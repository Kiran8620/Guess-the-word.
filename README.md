##Word Scramble Game
Overview
This Word Scramble Game is a fun and educational game where players try to unscramble words within a limited number of guesses. Players can play two levels:

Level 1 (Basic): Words are easier, familiar, and shorter.
Level 2 (Hard): Words are more advanced and challenging.
Players have two lives per word, and each correct guess increases their score. Once all guesses are exhausted, the game ends, and the player's final score is displayed.

Scrambled Words: The game scrambles the letters of the selected word randomly for the player to guess.
Life Lines: Players get two lives per word to guess correctly.
Score Tracking: Playersâ€™ scores are tracked and updated with every correct guess.
End Game Message: The game displays the player's final score and offers an option to reset the game.

How to Play
Start the Game:

Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
The game will show a scrambled word from the Basic level.
Guess the Word:

Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
You have two attempts (lives) per word. If you guess correctly, your score increases. If you fail both attempts, the game moves to the next word.
Winning or Losing:

If you guess correctly, your score will increase, and a new word will appear.
If you run out of lives for a word, the game will show the correct answer and give you the next word.
The game ends once all lives are used or you decide to quit.
Restart the Game:

Click the "Reset" button to restart the game from the beginning.
Game Logic
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words, scrambles its letters, and presents it to the player. The player must then guess the correct word within two attempts (lives). If guessed correctly, the score increases. The game continues with new words until the player runs out of lives.
